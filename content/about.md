I work on editorial initiatives at the [Vera List Center for Art & Politics](https://veralistcenter.org/) at The New School and manage editorial production at [Ugly Duckling Presse](https://uglyducklingpresse.org). I hold a BFA from Rhode Island School of Design and a MA from Brown University. My research interests are within the fields of critical pedagogy studies, media studies, and aesthetics. I'm particularly interested in how labor and autonomy, how play and restraint, are, individually and simultaneously, enacted and denied within certain structures. 

For fun, I try and collect things on my [Are.na](https://www.are.na/wen-z). And watch movies that I write about on my blog, [Code Unknown](https://code-unknown.com/). There's also the newsletter I run, [A&nbsp;Fountain](https://afountain.substack.com/).
