          <a>
            There is perhaps no better time for mandatory solitude than right now. We have all become master pretenders, comfortably encased in what French sociologist Jean Baudrillard has deemed a distinct, postmodern “fourth-order simulacra.” Understood as the last of four Baudrillardian’s theoretical “epochs,” the fourth precession moves from the peculiar societal relationship that humans have to images and icons, where “the image masks the absence of a profound reality,” to a relationship where “the image has no relation to any reality.” Put in simpler terms, Baudrillard warned against a certain type of extension of our daily lives into a realm which takes the simulated image or icon as our reality. In this realm, living our lives becomes perpetuating certain images and icons. We begin to interpret and approach our most private spaces and personal lives through the lens of media images, and our actions reflect not reality, but a simulation. In other words, we become stuck in a peculiar space between inside and outside; except the boundary that separates the two is increasingly elusive. Decidedly, this is an exaggeration—we adorn our Animal Crossing rooms with pastiche furniture, hold raves for 5,000+ on Club Penguin, share images of bread, and turn our living rooms into yoga studios, but there is still an overall understanding that profound reality is not this. While our actual rooms might be lackluster in comparison, we are still in them, as non-pixel entities. And once this moment concludes, we would very much like to break out of solitude, destroy it, and never return to it.<br><br> 
            Enforced social distance (and thus digitized socializing) complicates Baudrillard's delineated epochs by eradicating any sense of order by succession, or removing any barrier between commodified and decommodified life. It becomes distinctly difficult for artists, writers, and anyone who already often finds these two lives in cahoots with each other. Individuals whose “work” is largely defined or inspired by their inner, private lives don’t exactly benefit when the situation is flipped. It is an artist’s private life, one’s “poetic” life, that is now at risk, as many are asked to transform the space of our home into tools for production. The space separating objects (or products) needed to live a life, and objects for which a need is created by commercial images, is compressed. Our bed is our studio is our gym is our office is our dining table.</a><br><br> 
            <img class="image" src="assets/ge_cover.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='assets/default.jpg'"><br><br>
            <a>When art professors around the world task their students with “Make with what you have” or “Imagine what is possible with enforced parameters,” and present these tasks as equivalent to the work done in one’s studio or metal shop, they simultaneously introduce and risk a third realm that is not simulation or reality, but what Wallace Stevens termed “Supreme Fiction”—in other words, imagination. This, I believe, is poetry’s stake in our current reality. It is within the less than innocent task to make art no matter what—especially when this urge masks a larger, bureaucratic failure in art institutions to consider the financial depletion that complete shutdown of facilities and studios has caused—that an artist's private potential for poiesis, or their “act of making,” is hindered. In other words, the poetry inherent in living and responding to a life is coerced for capital gain. This coercion does not exist outside the general interest of imposing a sense of capital security, or function, onto artists for the satisfaction of certain commercialized cultural norms. The specific capital coercion brought upon by mandated digital life, however, penetrates an additional affective layer, one that requires an exposition not only of the public but of the delicate private, too. Artists are asked to transform their homes, which before this was maybe just a place of rest, a house and nothing more, into Pee-wee’s Playhouse mockups, to then be considered and observed through Zoom, under the forced assertion that true artists should have the ability to give everything meaning. This task is concerned not with the autonomously imagined landscapes that we might have for our daily, private, banal spaces, but how we might translate this space and project it outward, for the consideration of the masses. Imagination is awarded, but only if it has a purpose in mind. “Poetry is everywhere” becomes “Poetry must be everywhere.”<br><br>
            I find myself seeking a North Star in the blemished and busy digital universe that has shadowed our homes, and have returned to the most revolutionary set of poems on the domestic space (and arguably on the method of poetry itself): Gertrude Stein’s Tender Buttons. In these sets of poems (though it’s hard to classify them as only that), Stein attempts to itemize objects in a home, likely hers. She ultimately forms a taxonomic representation of an inner architecture—what looks at first to be a packing list for a mover or for a grocery shopper. Some are commonplace: “a box;” others are tinged with artifice: “careless water.” Idling into my second month of quarantine, I have, consciously or otherwise, attempted to imitate this aspect of Tender Buttons, having walked the area of my house more times in one day than I normally would in a week. I am taking inventory of my house: a loose faucet, an obstructive shelf, a book lost under my bed, and making a list of my own. However, the task in Tender Buttons proves more profound, and perhaps impossible.<br><br>
             Once you get past the initial itemization and arrive at the actual descriptions Stein affords these objects, Stein positions the reader at a loss. The revolution of Tender Buttons is in its withholding of these objects. Even in their plainness and their commodified everyday understanding—or to return to Baudrillard, the objects’ “simulation” in our reality—Stein does not present useful descriptions. An umbrella or a red dress appear on the page as nearly unintelligible ruminations of a slew of abstract ideas, of all that Stein imagines personally through this object. It presents a distinctly private phenomenon—the piano in Tender Buttons is the piano as it exists only in Stein.</a><br><br>

            <p class="indent">A PIANO: If the speed is open, if the color is careless, if the selection of a strong scent is now awkward, if the button holder is held by all the waving color and there is no color, not any color. If there is no dirt in a pin and there can be none scarcely, if there is not then the place is the same as up standing. There is no dark custom and it even is not acted in any such a way that a restraint is not spread. That is spread, it shuts and it lifts and awkwardly not awkwardly the centre is in standing.</p><br><br>

            <a>By itemizing her entire house, pantry, and rooms, she has done the remarkable job of never actually exposing them to us. This is perhaps why critics and readers of Stein most naturally opt to consider these as “poems” or attribute her writing to “Steinese,” a unique language unknowable to even poetry. This is also precisely why Tender Buttons toggles the contentious area between the poetry of something as simulacrum and poetry as imagination. “Poetry is everything” becomes tarnished in the realm of the former, but preserved in the latter. 
            Most of us have, to our privilege, never been mandated to stay within the confines of our home. The home, moreover, can represent something vastly different for every person; it can appear as the glistening walls of an undiscovered treasure trove or as the bleak, unfamiliar margins of a doctor’s waiting room. The approaches we each take to familiarize ourselves with our sudden close quarters will differ for a multitude of reasons, restrictions, and expectations. And when we’ve done all that, there’s still the responsibility, as artists, to continue to produce—not because we are still enrolled students, or employed in some capacity, but because it is a necessity that yields only to us.</a><br><br>
            <img class="image" src="assets/gs.png" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='assets/default.jpg'"><br><br>
            <a>It is a difficult task to resist, or not falter under, the increased expectation of productivity from artists during this time. Our “home videos” can now join the ranks of MoMA’s exhibition “Private Lives, Public Spaces” through a tag on Instagram; our letters to friends and family can be doubled as postcards featured on Printed Matter’s website. This expectation to transform our inner spaces and internal routines into marketable ‘poetry’ is masked as an attempt to retain a sense of ‘normalcy,’ a continuation of our ‘real lives.’ Ironically, however, this expectation ignores what is actually our reality, and our new normal. My attempt to reframe our relationship to our homes through the lens of poetry, of Tender Buttons, and the exhortations of Baudrillard may only be to remind us of the importance of maintaining our home just for individual, intimate, and solitary living. And, if this proves impossible, of carving out a space that remains untainted by simulation. A place where the leaves of your plant can remind you of a certain pastel color (imagination as poetry), but where the leaves of that plant don’t need to transform into a physical tool to make work (simulacrum as poetry). In other words, it is just as ‘essential’ to refuse the infiltration of work into your home. It is not imperative we prescribe multifaceted function onto our spaces, and not vital that we force digital alternatives to things that refuse that potential.<br><br>
            Poetry, for me (and I’d like to think for Stein, Baudrillard, and most artists), is indeed everywhere. Most of the time, however, it just exists and nothing more, suspended around me in a kind of limbo, much like the space we find ourselves in today. I’m okay if it stays there, and unbothered if it leaves and never finds its way back. Just as I’m content with poetry to sometimes not hold much meaning, to me, or anyone else.<br><br>

          <a><em>NOTE: THIS INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED in early May, when the world was just beginning to adjust to various forms of pandemic response. Since then, the global Black Lives Matter movement has further called into question nearly every system we find ourselves a part of. A critical dismantling of the corporate structures that uphold academic institutions can no longer remain a speculation, but a necessity. With Wages Against Artwork, Leigh Claire La Berge maintains that the artist — whether student, educator, or social worker — may be at the forefront of the reconfiguration of capital systems.<br><br>
           “When all life is work, when should we get paid and for what? For showing up at work? For the time it takes to travel there? For (not) sleeping through the night?” The questions author Leigh Claire La Berge asks in Wages Against Artwork: Decommodified Labor and the Claims of Socially Engaged Art have an inauspicious, but no longer distant relevance in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic as the slippery structures of universities and art institutions are quickly eroding. With many closed for an unprecedented amount of time, denying students the access to facilities and forms of interaction that has upheld obscene tuition hikes in BFA and MFA programs, how can the fight for wages and an equitable approach to student labor be reconsidered?<br><br>
           In Wages Against Artwork, published last August by Duke University press, La Berge shows how socially engaged artists respond to what she terms “decommodified labor” — the slow diminishment of wages alongside an increase in the demands of work — and how the expansion of MFA programs and student debt create the conditions for this labor. A few months into the global lockdown, I sat down with La Berge to discuss how this phenomenon has shifted in the face of university closures, and what this global crisis could mean for the relationship between art and capitalism.</em><br><br></a>

            WEN ZHUANG: Are you currently teaching? I realize the school year has come to a close somewhat. But I wonder, if you are, how you’ve found the adjustment. If you aren’t, are there things you’ve noticed about the so-called “Zoom University”? It’s attracted largely critics, but also some hopeful supporters.<br><br>
            LEIGH CLAIRE LA BERGE: I’m on a research grant this semester, so I’m not teaching. For me, personally, it has not been a radical change. I certainly have done online teaching before. This question about the “Zoom University” I talk about in my article “The Market Correction in the Humanities.” This is sort of distinct from the book, but it’s been my impression that — to use a sort of financial metaphor — universities, particularly private, particularly smaller schools, they’re overleveraged, right? They’re not secure financially. They rely on the federal government to indebt a huge number of students to be able to function. I wrote that piece 10 months ago, last August. The idea that universities would encounter something that would cause mass closings seemed very likely. I had no idea that what would happen would be a global viral pandemic. That was the furthest thing from my mind. Certainly a financial shock of the kind that we saw in 2007 and 2008 with the global credit crisis could do that. This seems to have engendered something very similar, even if its origins are very different.<br><br>

            Because of how these dormant issues against higher education, especially art education, have been dredged up due to this pandemic, I was most curious about the first and second chapters of your book. Could you reframe the ideas — about the art student as laborer and the art institution — in the context of right now?<br><br>
            I can see why you would be drawn to those chapters. So, I think it’s a scary moment for education; I think particularly for liberal arts and art schools. That said, I think we were already in a scary moment for them. Not to be too sanguine about it. I do think the model of private education that requires a huge amount of student debt is one that needs to be really questioned and rendered obsolete. The reason I start chapter one of my book with the organizing students were doing in the 1970s is to highlight how we might think of “studentdom” completely separately. Rather than something one purchases, it’s something that one works for and gets paid for. I mean, it’s still the model in parts of the world — parts of Mexico, parts of Europe — you get paid to get an undergraduate education. It’s considered a form of labor, there’s no tuition. To me, that’s a much more equitable model, a much more sustainable model. Will this crisis lead to that? I don’t know, but I think it’s important to point out that history.<br><br>

            I was drawn to your use of the phrase “studentdom.” It feels the crisis that has befallen art institutions has compromised the potential for that kind of studentdom, or maybe it hasn’t.<br><br>
            I think, if you look at something that I also discuss in chapter one, the sort of political force and political organizing that we saw in Occupy Wall Street in 2011 and the Strike Debt protest of 2012, artists and cultural workers were central to those movements. The question might be: “What can artists and cultural workers, and the relationship between the two, make possible?” People who graduate from schools like RISD, who become cultural workers (and not everyone will), what can they do to force a radical reconvening of the horizon of arts and humanities education in the United States in the 21st century? I do think the model we have now is a very problematic model, and one that’s not sustainable for so long. It’s also a fairly new model itself — a postwar, post-1970s model — and it has changed into this, and therefore it can change into something else.<br><br>

            The reality for art students in this interruption feels distinctly bleak. Many are without facilities and thus without the ability to produce work — work that they not only used for capital gain, but that the school commodified toward the accrual of capital potential for the institution. The things that justified the obscene tuition rates at some of these art schools — studio space, interaction with and connection to working artists, ability to show work — are now all inaccessible.<br><br>
            I think it’s a really interesting question and yeah, the displacement of art students all over the country from their facilities, it certainly does — and I hadn’t thought about this until you asked the question — it does resonate with certain forms of deindustrialization, in the matter of one week or two weeks, not decade-wide or century-wide transformations. One thing I want to clarify is that one term I don’t use in the book, and it’s purposeful, is that I don’t use the term cultural capital, a term introduced, in the late ’60s, early ’70s, by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. I think I go into it in the second chapter. To me, the problem with the concept of cultural capital is that it seems like an extension of a concept of regular capital, which is that people who have capital also seem to have cultural capital, and people who don’t, don’t. I didn’t think of this when I wrote the book but now that we’re talking about it, it’d be interesting to wonder and pose it as a question: Have artists embraced that narrative about themselves, and if so, why? And what does that tell us about the current state of arts and art education? In the ’70s, in the case of Wages for Students, those students were not using a language like “We already have capital, therefore…”. Instead they were saying, “We need money, we need a wage, we’re not going to consider this a form of accumulation.” What I would ask you, what maybe you could speak to your colleagues about: Does something like this event, the COVID-19 pandemic, will it, or can it interrupt the discourse of cultural capital, as it circulates in art school, in art worlds, in art students, and can it offer a chance to reflect? What has that discourse really done for people, for artists? Is that a story they tell to each other, to themselves? How does the story of cultural capital mesh with an organization like Wage, which demands and lists a schedule of compensation for certain events? So, I don’t know the answers to those questions, but they seem like interesting questions.<br><br>

            What has been a concern for me, and I wouldn’t consider myself a working artist in the way many of my peers are, is the move from a decommodified labor in institutions to a similar, if more deviant, online labor system. Museums, galleries, and schools have merely forced the modes of capital we engage with onto the internet.<br><br>
            It’s certainly undeniable that people are spending more time online, here we are online right now (I don’t want to question that) but I do think we need to question what exactly it is that we are doing online. Is it decommodified labor? Is it something else? Is it what the socialist Christian Fuchs terms “digital labor”? What is the term? Is it affective labor? I think we have to be careful to not give too much attention to the online platform. One work I found very interesting to think about this is Platform Capitalism. It’s a fascinating book. Nick Srnicek looks at these different platforms like Facebook, Google, I don’t know if he looks at Instagram (but it’s now owned by Facebook). He asks: Is platform capitalism a new kind of accumulation, or is it a form of monopoly rent? The idea that FB owns this real estate, that Zoom owns this real estate that you and I are currently talking on. One of the things he says that relates to my concept of “decommodified” is: If you look at how these companies actually make money, they make money by paying workers really low wages. I think there’s a certain amount of continuity there. We would be too quick to think that capitalism, as it happens on and through the internet as a form of media, is that distinct from capitalism as it happened in film, or in television, or even in print culture in the 19th century. That said, if schooling is a form of work, which I claim in the book that it is, and this work is all taking place via these platforms, does that require a new thinking of platform capitalism? Is that not another form of monopoly real estate? Could we say you’re going to school at your university and Instagram? Or your university and Zoom? What’s the relationship between these different forms of accumulation? But I do think we can’t be too quick to fetishize or anoint on these technologies ideas of newness that sort of reconfigure what it is these companies do, which is that they make money by trying to keep wages low. It does take us back to the question of the wage. I think it also relates to one of your questions: what does a new art institution look like?<br><br>

            Yes, I was curious about the two examples you use in your book, in chapter two, when you speak about art institutions, the art practices of Caroline Woolard and Renzo Martens. Do you see these “new institutions” brought about by artists like Woolard and Martens as having the potential to be replacements for the institutions we abide by today?<br><br>
            I would almost combine that question with your last, on if these platforms are becoming art institutions. I think the question of building new art institutions as art works, what Caroline and Renzo are trying to do, is more distinct than just building a new institution. With that said, I know that those two artists in particular are very interested in transforming art education and the way art education is taught. They are rightly very skeptical of the model of the MFA, or maybe even the BFA. When you go hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt in a professional credential in a tradition that doesn’t necessarily need to be credentialed. I mean, the main point of that credential is to go back and teach in universities, and there are no jobs there. It could be a very interesting moment to look at what kind of artist-run institutions perhaps rise out of this moment to challenge a sort of MFA dominance. I wouldn’t presume to say that they can, or what form they would take, but the work of these artists has amazing organizing potential, in terms of infrastructures and working with artists. How would that be received? Would people engage with that? Would people flock to that? Is there a critical mass willing to turn away from the MFA? I think that’s going to be the really interesting question to come out of this panic. I think we thought there would be in 2007 and 2008, and that was not the case. In fact, since 2008, we’ve seen a continued proliferation of new MFA programs. We’ll see.<br><br>

            The home itself can now fairly be considered an institution, or it’s being pushed to institutionalize daily. Our bed is our studio is our kitchen is our gym, right? Could you speak a little bit about that? What is the relationship to deindustrialization and the now multifaceted home space?<br><br>
            The house is a really interesting use of the concept of deindustrialization. I think when people think of deindustrialization, and when the term gets used in social scientific literature, it’s to refer to a massive devaluing of fixed capital. These are things like factories, workers’ housing, infrastructure, streets, street lights, pipes, water, I mean things that make it possible for industrial production to take place. In the book, for example, I talk about a city like Manchester, England, a famous industrial city in the 19th century, and now not so much. The great record company, Factory Records, started using that ironic name. It started in an old abandoned factory. In the American context, it’s a place like Detroit. Where at the height of its population growth and productive power in the 1940s and ’50s, it had about two million residents. Now it has less than one million. It’s not just that the fixed capital loses its value; it’s that the population itself starts to disappear. What enabled the population to congregate initially is the mode of production. To think about what has happened during the COVID-19 pandemic from early March onward as a kind of deindustrialization can be in the sense that schools and universities provide an industrial apparatus for students who may not have access to it — things like consistent wi-fi, computer use, or “the shop,” the tools, or the “shop tech” in art schools — that’s now all gone, and evaporated, although we don’t know for how long.<br><br>

            Right. And the issues become infinitely clear now that the things that justified the obscene tuition rates at some of these art schools are inaccessible.<br><br>
            So, what does it mean to think about that as a kind of deindustrialization? I think it’s a really interesting and provocative use of the term. Specifically in that industrialization itself has been sort of localized to 19th- and early 20th-century capitalist democracies, right? Now, when you think of an industrializing economy, you’d probably think of China. In the places Saskia Sassen terms “global cities” (New York, Hong Kong) is a kind of “digital infrastructure.” What is digital infrastructure? It’s also an industrial infrastructure, it also relies on an industrial infrastructure. This is a long way to try and answer your question, which is to say that the terms we use to periodize capitalism: industrializing, deindustrialization, production, finance, financialization. They don’t just happen in sequence. They happen at different times; they don’t happen progressively. One of them happens and another happens. I think one of the things that this crisis is showing is that the conventional infrastructure we understand as needed to pursue art education may not be needed. It’s too soon to judge what the effects of that are. Is that going to produce a moment of liberation and reconfiguration of the liberal arts education for better or for worse? Is it really not possible, or ideal, to have art education being conducted by so many students spread out all over the world, living in their bedrooms, for those who have bedrooms, as you point out? It shows us both the panacea that the university offers when it’s working well; it also really shows us the limits of that institution, the university, the ability to provide for its students under forms of duress, its ability to do so under any notion of duress.<br><br>

            Claire Bishop’s notion that “everybody is an art student” is something you mention in the book. I think that’s even more true now that the starting line has been pushed back for everyone, not just art students. How do you see the theories presented in this book extending toward other fields, humanities naturally, but even the sciences, business?<br><br>
            I really appreciate the question; my hope for the concept of decommodified labor is that it can be used quite broadly. I focus on four sites where we see decommodified labor. I say this in the book but I want to reiterate that in the United States, since the mid- to late 1970s, there has essentially been no wage increase for a great majority of workers. What I mean by that is wages relative to inflation have not risen. The stock market has risen 10 times over in value, right? That’s one metric of social wealth. The other metric of social wealth, how labor is valued, has remained relatively stagnant. These two indices of value have a relationship to each other. One of the ways we see what a finance-heavy economy requires and does is first in stagnant wages and then in disappearing wages. That’s what the concept of decommodified labor is really meant to address.<br><br>

            Do you see this form of decommodified labor already existent in other places?<br><br>
            When I was first developing the concept, I first noticed it in arts. In gallery scenes, social practice, in informal art scenes, in 2012, 2013, when I was beginning to get the ideas for this book. But then I started noticing it in other places. For example, professional sports, which we don’t think of as often as having a close relationship to the art world. In so many ways, they are constructed and they function very similarly. There are a few stars who get paid a lot of money and have a lot of visibility but most people who exist in that world exist as, what we would call in sports, an “amateur.” The difference in art is you could go to art school and train as an arts professional whereas in sports you can’t decide to do that. Today I can decide to get an MFA and be a professional artist, I couldn’t decide today that I’m going to be a professional football player. Nothing exists to make that happen for me. Nonetheless, a majority of professional sports is run on volunteer labor. So, if you go to a golf event or a tennis event, not everybody but a majority of people working there, they have volunteered to be there. They still have to abide by certain rules, they have to wear a uniform, they have a boss, all these things we associate with a formal job. It exists throughout the university: forms of peer review, undergraduate serving as teaching assistants, a huge amount of scientific research is undertaken as free work. It also happens throughout the art world; I’m not talking about artists as I was talking about in the book. I’m talking about all the volunteers at the Met, at the MoMA, all the volunteers at smaller art museums. And the model of secondary public education in this country, which is run through the PTA, which is the largest volunteer organization. We don’t really think of volunteering for something we enjoy doing as a form of decommodified labor, but it is. Someone can be paid to do that job. Instead someone is showing up and doing it for free. They don’t call it a job, they call it volunteering. Now we’re in this crisis, and we’ll see what happens. It didn’t start as an economic crisis, but it certainly will have that effect. As a result of the 2007–2008 crisis, in the humanities, many jobs that were lost and many places that asked of faculty and graduate students to give more of their time for less money will never return to those conditions. So I would expect something similar to happen. At the same time, I’m really excited by and enthusiastic for the organizing efforts that have come out of the crisis. I don’t think we’ve seen them exactly in places of decommodified labor yet. I was just reading a few weeks ago in The New York Times a headline that said something like, “Unemployment has skyrocketed, but so has the volunteer pool.” These two things are so closely related.<br><br>

            This book itself already transcends disciplines, at least the process. You having worked largely in academia, now collaborating with various artists, and ultimately conceiving of this book. What was the process like for this book and your last?<br><br>
            Well, my first book is called Scandals and Abstraction, the relationship between finance and literature. Finance is an economic form, literature is an art form. This book is a different economic form, decommodified labor. And a different art form, socially engaged art. I do teach in an English department but my PhD was in American Studies, so I think of my work as quite interdisciplinary. It wasn’t my hope to teach in an English department but there aren’t that many American Studies departments and not that many jobs, so I’m very grateful to have one. I think the biggest difference is in my first book, the authors that I treated were very canonical authors: Bret Easton Ellis, Don DeLillo, Jane Smiley, you know, big people. This book, mostly, I think every artist that I wrote about, I talked with, I interviewed, I in some cases became friends with. In all cases, shared my writing with and asked them what they thought. In many cases, when I would interview them, or be having a conversation with them, they brought me into their world; the world of socially engaged art is not that big in New York City. I hadn’t thought this before, but your question prompted it. In retrospect, at certain points I sort of tried to adapt the methodology of social practice. Which is to collaborate with people in a different area than you, to make some sort of efficacious effort in a social world to change something. I’m not sure if I changed anything but I tried to produce a new concept. But it was one that could only have been done in collaboration and conversation with these people. I tried to select artists who I had different relationships toward, but who I also think understood and understand and respond to the decommodification of their labor differently. Some of the artists I write about, it really is freeing and liberating. For others, it is immiserating and quite constricting. I didn’t necessarily want to weigh in on which is the truth, or the right relationship to have to this economic form, so much as I wanted to say, here: This economic form exists, this is what it looks like, and what do we make of it? It’s an open-ended question that I hope the book ends with, but you can tell me.<br><br>

            This notion of freeing it makes me think of the idea of commoning, which has been extended to the consideration of the “undercommons.” It’s arrived as students freeing themselves from that which restricts them, the MFA program, and so on. What is the relationship of decommodified labor and the approach of commoning?<br><br>
            I think that’s really interesting and I’m sort of appreciative that my concept made you think of that. I do think, and I say this in the book, in terms of Marxist theory and Marxist aesthetic theory, one of the main differences with decommodified labor is that it really tries to maintain an idiom or a sort of lexicon that comes out of Marxist analysis of capitalism and that’s the commodity form. To me, that’s generative, not just of our social world, but of so much of our aesthetic discourse. At a certain point, that’s a question of method. The second answer is to say that I think the other reason that decommodification is a more modest term is that it’s already a carve-out of a commodified landscape or world. Whereas I think the hope for the commons is a much more radical transformation of not only our world but our imagination thereof. And that’s what I appreciate about it, and that’s also what sometimes frustrates me about it. I write about this also in chapter two, where I talk about art critics use of terms like “revolutionary” or “transformative.” To me, I think there’s a real gap between that kind of language and what actually happens in different art spaces and how people interact with it. So I want to force a sort of reconciliation of where does this art come from and what do we do with it. I think a book you’d find interesting in relation to this question came from a CUNY colleague, Matt Brim. It’s called Poor Queer Studies. The book concerns itself with this question of how do you do this kind of theory at an underfunded public university. Has my book changed my relationship? I mean, honestly, my relationship to universities is better reflected in the two articles I sent you. I do share with my students parts of chapter one. I ask of them: Why aren’t you fighting to get wages? Why don’t you do that? In that sense, learning this history has changed the kinds of questions I ask my students. The responses I get from them are like, what in the world are you talking about? They are not even opposed to tuition increases, most of them. They don’t want free education, even though CUNY used to be free. It’s a realistic answer to your question, which is to say that the gap of what I write about in that book and the daily realities of teaching is quite big and needs to reimagined.<br><br>

            Any advice to students currently involved in an MFA? What do you think is the one important thing to take this time to reflect on?<br><br>
            I think it would be the question of: What kind of art world do they want to inhabit? Maybe the realization that not necessarily who you see when you’re Zooming in your bedroom is your art world. I hope it’s a little bit more expansive than that. But I do think that who your community is and what kind of art world you exist in now is your art world. So I guess what I would hope is that maybe this experience would provoke the question: If this is the art world that we will exist in, what do we make of it? If the art world is not out there, in Chelsea, in a biennial, in a global city somewhere else. If it’s actually here, then what are its grounds for development, and what are the possibilities of transforming it? I think so much of academic discourse that happens within universities, whether it’s in art school or a PhD program, or once you become a faculty member, is about trying to get elsewhere, get into a different conversation, get into a different conference, gallery, whatever it is. That the question of, how do we exist in the space we are in now and how do we reconcile it and transform it, is often not as exciting as the question of, how will it be when we get somewhere else? So this is where we all are now, right?<br><br>

          <a>The first day of online classes, in March, turned administrators into amateurs and students like us into IT professionals. Our classes were full of microphone malfunctions, lagging technology, and disjointed discussions. Between logging in and out of Zoom, we seemed stuck in a perpetual transition — an unsettling state of limbo — as our rapidly transitioned classes grew less efficient and less educational.<br><br>

          Within the past three months, students have filed</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.educationdive.com/news/will-lawsuits-for-tuition-refunds-succeed-it-depends-experts-say/578214/">over 100</a>
          <a>lawsuits demanding tuition refunds due to the compromised quality of students’ education during the coronavirus pandemic. These lawsuits — against both public and private institutions, including ours,</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200501/brown-university-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-over-coronavirus-closing"> Brown University </a>
          <a>— argue that because the quality of online education is significantly lower than in-person classes, universities cannot ethically demand the same tuition payments. At the heart of these lawsuits rests an incisive critique of administrative hypocrisy, namely, the doublespeak that allows administrators to claim, on the one hand, that on-campus learning is of vital importance to our college experience, and, on the other, that it adds no value to a student’s degree.<br><br>

          Most elite private institutions like Brown have stubbornly refused to issue tuition refunds during the coronavirus crisis, despite their clear ability to do so, given their bloated endowments, high administrative salaries, successful fund-raising efforts, and</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/13/cost-of-college-increased-by-more-than-25percent-in-the-last-10-years.html#:~:text=From%202008%20to%202018%2C%20the,on%20Budget%20and%20Policy%20Priorities."> steady tuition </a>
          <a>increases. Instead, prominent administrators have largely focused on the financial health of wealthy colleges. In a New York Times</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/opinion/coronavirus-colleges-universities.html">  op-ed  </a>
          <a>in April, Christina Paxson, our university’s president, focused on the economic troubles that loom if college campuses do not reopen in the fall. In May, Paxson outlined</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/05/23/browns-financial-deficit-fiscal-year-2021-range-100-million-200-million/">  detailed plans </a>
          <a>for the recovery of Brown’s projected economic deficit but released only vague intentions about how Brown will prepare to safeguard community health upon reopening.<br><br>

          Last Tuesday, she announced Brown’s plans for a hybrid semester of both in-person and online coursework but made no mention of tuition cuts. With the notable exception of Princeton University — which recently</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/07/06/harvard-reopen-with-fewer-than-half-undergrads-campus-because-coronavirus/#:~:text=Princeton%20University%20announced%20Monday%20it,aims%20to%20provide%20education%20through"> announced </a>
          <a>a 10-percent tuition cut for the coming year — as other colleges announce their fall plans, the collective disregard for tuition imbalances has been deafening.<br><br>

          A full priced fall semester presents different struggles for different students, including those who are</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Cruelty-of-ICE-s/249133">  international</a>
          <a>, low income, recently unemployed or undercompensated due to the economic shutdowns, or immunocompromised. As we confront a global pandemic, issuing tuition refunds is a crucial first step toward ensuring that the economic well-being of students is neither dismissed nor exploited.<br><br>

          As the class-action lawsuits are quick to point out, the importance of on-campus education is consistently celebrated by university administrators and underscored in admission materials. According to Paxson’s op-ed, students who live on campus benefit from the “research opportunities in university laboratories and libraries” and the “fierce intellectual debates that just aren’t the same on Zoom.” As emphasized in our university’s</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/07/06/harvard-reopen-with-fewer-than-half-undergrads-campus-because-coronavirus/#:~:text=Princeton%20University%20announced%20Monday%20it,aims%20to%20provide%20education%20through"> admission materials</a>
          <a>, Brown undergraduates are required to live on campus through their junior year in order to benefit from Brown’s “exceptional learning environment.” In an</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-we-have-a-responsibility-to-open-purdue-university-this-fall/2020/05/25/da3b615c-9c62-11ea-ac72-3841fcc9b35f_story.html"> op-ed </a>
          <a>published in The Washington Post, Mitch Daniels, the president of Purdue University, emphasizes that failing to return to campus would be a “gross disservice” to students and a “default of our responsibility.”<br><br>

          In the midst of Covid-19, however, administrators have moved quickly to contradict these statements with a firm stance against refunds or tuition discounts. In an</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/04/28/reopening-economy-universities-funding-coronavirus-squawk-box.html"> interview </a>
          <a>with CNBC, Paxson countered her own op-ed’s argument about the necessity of on-campus learning, emphasizing that the “value of degrees aren’t diminished in any way” with remote digital learning. This contradictory logic, employed in each instance to ensure the financial security of the university, underscores the</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/University-Leaders-Are-Failing/248809"> corporate philosophy </a><a>that has swept academe.
          As Leigh Claire La Berge</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/11082019-LaBerge"> has asserted </a>
          <a>in these pages, “Higher-ed institutions have for some time been substituting a corporate vocabulary for a scholastic one: their students have become ‘consumers,’ their faculty and alumni are ‘stakeholders,’ they seek to enhance their ‘brand’ and bolster their students’ ‘investments.” (According to a 2018</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.cic.edu/r/cd/Pages/Presidents-Report-2018.aspx"> report </a>
          <a>produced by the Council of Independent Colleges, 80 percent of university presidents said fund raising was among their major time commitments.)<br><br>

          The hypocrisy of university administrators raises a fundamental question. What does tuition pay for, if not the venerated collegiate experience? As one Northwestern student</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-college-refund-for-coronavirus-11586299536"> put it </a>
          <a>to The Wall Street Journal, “Would you pay $75,000 for front-row seats to a Beyoncé concert and be satisfied with a livestream instead?”<br><br>

          Paxson’s rhetorical gymnastics reveal the intense anxiety of university administrators as they grapple with an existential crisis. If elite universities want to preserve the pretense on which they charge over $70,000 a year, they must recognize the compromised quality of their online semesters, by first issuing tuition refunds, then by offering tuition cuts for the coming semester. Otherwise, they implicitly acknowledge the obsolescence of their model.<br><br>

          To argue that our on-campus experience remains uncompromised during even a partially remote semester is ridiculous. It confirms the premonition long held by critics of private higher education — that what tuition at elite institutions actually buys is a brand name and that, given the crisis of unemployment and the crisis of student debt, this brand name is itself a hollow and obsolete promise.<br><br>

          As of this year, more than 45 million people</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://strike.debtcollective.org/"> collectively owe </a>
          <a>nearly $1.6 trillion in U.S. student-loan debt. The nation’s student debt crisis, which became a major topic of debate in the recent democratic primaries, continues to dictate the lives and aspirations of millions of Americans and disproportionately affects low-income students and families.<br><br>

          Last February, Brown’s governing board, which already charges students more than $73,000 a year,</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/02/10/brown-corporation-approves-3-75-percent-tuition-increase/"> decided </a>
          <a>to approve a 3.75-percent increase in undergraduate tuition for the 2020-21 fiscal year. Defenders of such tuition hikes argue that universities like Brown act as institutional Robin Hoods, taking large tuition payments from wealthy individuals and providing financial aid to working-class students.<br><br>

          Yet according to estimates produced by Opportunity Insights’s</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/brown-university"> “Mobility Report Cards,” </a>
          <a>only about 1.5 percent of students at Brown come from poor families and become rich adults. The median family income of a student at Brown is over $200,000, and more students come from the top 1 percent of income distribution than from the bottom 60 percent. While the importance of financial aid at institutions like Brown cannot be overstated, elite universities are a far cry from being agents of redistribution.<br><br>

          Instead, as the Brooklyn College professor Corey Robin</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-pandemic-is-the-time-to-resurrect-the-public-university"> writes </a>
          <a>in The New Yorker, it is public universities — not private universities with soaring tuition rates — that are the drivers of upward mobility. Universities like the City University of New York offer educational opportunities to hundreds of thousands of poor and working-class students. (The “Mobility Report Cards” placed three of CUNY’s 25 colleges in the top 10 colleges that generate the most upward mobility). Tuition refunds would begin to offer elite universities a means to redress their complicity in maintaining class hierarchies by returning tuition back to their students.<br><br>

          As shown by Princeton’s announcement of a 10-percent tuition cut, there are still immediate and tangible ways that universities like Brown can redirect their finances.</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.aaup.org/article/hampshire-college-aaup-chapter#.XwgOptP0lE5"> Organized </a>
          <a>faculty at Hampshire College, for example, have decided to work collaboratively to produce “a fiscally prudent budget” to prevent faculty layoffs and maintain a high quality of instruction.</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://universitybusiness.com/hampshire-faculty-agree-to-salary-reductions/"> Agreements </a>
          <a>include senior professors taking larger cuts, and the president, Ed Wingenbach, taking a 50-percent pay cut.<br><br>

          In addition to collaborative budgeting, Brown could also redirect a portion of its extremely successful fund-raising campaigns, all established with the impetus of bettering student life. In 2015, Brown started #BrownTogether, the largest fund-raising campaign in its history. Of the $3 billion raised, over $495 million has been</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2019-03-14/campaign"> dedicated </a>
          <a>to “Campus and Community,” which supports, among other initiatives, “wellness programs and support for first-generation college students; and other campus life priorities” — a category under which the financial well-being of students surely falls.<br><br>

          Among the first budget decisions made in light of Covid-19, however, was a retraction of this commitment to community: hiring freezes, continued tuition hikes, adjunct layoffs, and the persistent denial of refunds. Meanwhile, construction continues on various property developments that have little to do with student, staff, or faculty well-being, including a flashy new performing-arts center funded via a</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/brown-university-receives-31.6-million-for-performing-arts-center"> $31.6 million </a>
          <a>gift.<br><br>

          Tuition refunds and tuition cuts offer elite private universities the chance to initiate a sustained, radical reconfiguration of university priorities, away from an increasingly corporate philosophy that exacerbates a crippling student debt crisis and toward an educational ethos that prioritizes the well-being of students. American private higher education has so far refused to reckon with the consequences of its financial inaccessibility, much less the</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.theindy.org/1849"> debt </a>
          <a>these institutions owe to the residents of the cities in which they are located. Tuition refunds, as a tangible means of redistribution and an immediate, highly symbolic recommitment to students, would signal a new beginning.<br><br></a>

         <a class="blurb">I reported on a new lawsuit filed through the Rhode Island Center for Justice, the failure of a proper civics education in public schools, and the potential for a non-partisan decision to be made on the basis of civics.</a>
          <div class="article">
          <a>Civic Disobedience: A class-action lawsuit in Rhode Island advocates for civics education. Co Written  with Sara Van-Horn</a>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.theindy.org/1616">Full text also available here.</a><br><br>
          <a>
            In 2015, only 23 percent of eighth graders in the United States demonstrated proficiency in civics, according to a national assessment by the federal government. Since 1998, the average civics score for this group has only increased by four points. This lack of civics education—basic knowledge of government and the democratic process—not only signals a highly uninformed electorate but is also indicative of the failure of the nation’s public education system. In the US, you are granted the right to vote when you turn 18, but not the right to know how or why.
            Professor Michael Rebell of Columbia University believes the time has come to establish education as a constitutional right. In 2016, Rebell began researching a legally-enshrined pathway to American civics education. His study draws on a 1973 Supreme Court Case, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, which declared that “the right to be educated” was not—as many of us may have assumed—“explicitly or implicitly” stated in the US Constitution. But in the same decision, the court acknowledged the importance of education in cultivating responsible citizens, raising an important question: does the Constitution guarantee the right to an education? After a sabbatical year spent researching this provocative and unanswered question, Rebell reached out to lawyers in Rhode Island last summer to find plaintiffs and file a lawsuit that would use securing the right to civics education as a means to codify education, broadly defined, as a constitutional right. The suit names six defendants: Governor Gina Raimondo, Speaker of the House Nicholas Mattiello, Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, Education Commissioner Ken Wagner, the Rhode Island Board of Education, and the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education.<br><br>
            The class-action lawsuit, A.C. vs. Raimondo, filed this past November, alleges that Rhode Island has failed to provide its public school students with the civics education necessary for full, democratic participation in American life. This formalized push for civics education appeals to supporters from across the political spectrum, in Rhode Island and around the country. The 14 student plaintiffs are fueled by what the suit alleges is inadequate civics preparation in the state. “We’re hoping we win this lawsuit and change it to where my younger brothers can have a really good education, and go into adulthood knowing how to vote, how to do taxes, and learning basic things that you should know going into the real world,” Aelita Cook, in her fourth year at the Providence Career & Technical Academy and one of the plaintiffs in the case, told the New York Times this past fall. These public school students span several age groups and hail from various school districts as well as different academic and cultural backgrounds.
            More broadly, the suit reflects the momentum of the current political moment, where public urgency for civics education reverberates nationwide. While the legal road ahead is long and certainly challenging, the groundbreaking potential of a favorable ruling has many education advocates excited. In conversation with the Independent, Jennifer Wood, a lawyer in the case and the Executive Director of RI Center for Justice, pointed to a myriad of powerful quotes in past Supreme Court cases about the fundamental importance of education. “We believe that we just haven’t asked the question the right way.”<br><br>

            The lawyers behind the case have set their sights high, aiming for no less than a judicial decision declaring education a constitutional right. The case is professionally spearheaded by a group of lawyers initially contacted by Professor Rebell: Jennifer Wood from Rhode Island Center for Justice, Samuel Zurier from Zurier Law, and Stephen Robinson from Robinson & Clapham Law Firm, all of whom have experience challenging educational practices in court.<br>
            In conversation with the Indy, Rebell noted the bleak reality of civics education across the country. “We could've brought this case in any of the 50 states because none of them are doing an adequate job,” he said. However, as Wood explained to the Independent, the choice of Rhode Island as Rebell’s “test case” was not an arbitrary one: “We have very difficult facts about some of the inequalities in some of the more economically distressed neighborhoods in PVD,” she said, pointing to a civics elective course that was eliminated in the Woonsocket school district following the 2008 recession.<br><br>
            Statistics published this past November also confirm this claim: recent Rhode Island Comprehensive Assessment System (RICAS) exam results reveal some sobering statistics: 34 percent of Rhode Island’s students in grades three to eight were considered just barely proficient in English Language Arts compared to 51 percent in neighboring Massachusetts, where an identical standardized test is administered.  Rhode Island also has a disappointing record in civics education: it is one of the few states that has no civics requirement in state-mandated curricula.<br><br>
            This disillusionment with state education policy reverberates across the working coalition behind the case. Robinson has worked on the subject for nearly 20 years, heading both Pawtucket v. Sundlun in 1995 and Woonsocket School Committee v. Chafee in 2014, the last two cases on state-level education reform. Although the former, which was directly linked to issues presented in the 1973 Rodriguez case around equitable funding in school districts, was reversed and lost in the Rhode Island Supreme Court, Robinson, recalling the case to the Independent, emphasized its subsequent impact: “As a result, for about 10 years, it was simply a recognition that we had to give more money to the poor districts.” Armed with the hopeful consequences from Pawtucket, Robinson along with Samuel D. Zurier (another lawyer in the current civics suit) tried again in Woonsocket School Committee 19 years later, this time arguing for equal funding with a larger focus constitutional rights and liberties, pointing directly to the education clause in the Rhode Island constitution. While unsuccessful a second time, it introduced the potentials of using a civics focus in legal arguments for equitable education.<br><br>
            “I’m hopeful that people will see [A.C. v. Raimondo] as something that isn’t a class thing,” said Robinson, “My past two cases were unpopular even in Rhode Island—you’re trying to take money from well-to-do wealthy people—but this is different. I think most people want fellow citizens to be engaged voters. Like back to Greek times.”<br><br>
            A.C. v. Raimondo is unique in its bipartisan support. While the case is heralded by some as a progressive effort to address educational inequities, Wood reminds us that the biggest Supreme Court champions of civics education have been Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Neil Gorsuch, appointed by Republican presidents. Republicans and Democrats find common ground in the struggle for civic participation, she argues, particularly when thinking about who is excluded from the democratic process. The lack of access to elite institutions and the civic preparation they provide is a topic where, Wood reminded us, “I could quote from both teams.” Public civics education is also something that particularly animates people attentive to the statements of the Founding Fathers, a style of reading first used in 1980s by Scalia and other conservative judges, and to the notion of democratic participation: “You can’t parse that along electoral political lines,” Wood said.<br><br>             
            </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

            <a>            
            These lawyers believe that specifically emphasizing civic participation as the goal of US public education will allow the courts to move beyond the aforementioned ruling in San Antonio v. Rodriguez, a case which failed to dismantle the unequal funding of public schools through property taxes—the underlying source of public educational inequality more broadly. “What the Supreme Court said in Rodriguez,” Wood explained to the Indy, “was that students don’t have a right to equivalent funding. That case was actually a funding equity case which is critically important to what our case is not.” A.C. v. Raimondo, in contrast, is a civics one, arguing that the question —whether or not education is protected under the constitution—is an open one.<br>
            Instead of fighting for the financial reform of public schools, this coalition of lawyers seeks to guarantee the right to an education by arguing that civic education is crucial to the full participation in American democracy. Their theory, according to Wood, is that “There are certain enumerated constitutional rights—the right to vote, the right to be judged by a jury of one’s peers, the right to exercise free speech—and that all of these enumerated constitutional rights are rendered inaccessible if you do not have the adequate education.” This legal strategy incorporates judicial precedent from hundreds of years ago and harkens back to the importance that the Founders themselves placed on civics education. As Wood explained, “You actually have to be a good student of civics to bring a civics case.”
            Yet the emphasis on civics is not a universal strategy among lawyers fighting for American educational rights. In Detroit, for example, a court case is seeking a similar declaration of educational rights on the basis of literacy. This different standard is especially alarming to Rebell, who told the Indy, “We're very concerned that if we're going to get one shot at the Supreme Court, the outcome shouldn't be that all you need to be a capable citizen is to be able to read and write at a sixth grade level.” Emphasizing civics, he argues, allows for a much more robust definition of education, one that is tailored to the political realities of the 21st century: increased internet use, for example, as well as heightened stress on widespread voter participation.<br><br>
            Additionally, newly available data on US public education can provide key supporting evidence that previous lawsuits lacked. Attributing this “literal mountain of data” to changes in data collection under President George W. Bush, Wood highlighted the new authority this data lends to claims of educational inequities. Instead of asking a judge to make a subjective assessment about educational standards, lawyers can use statistics to point to learning gaps between different groups of students based on race, gender, and income and to compare Rhode Island’s performance to national standards.<br><br>             
            </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

            <a>            
            The rightward shift in the political and social climate after the 2016 presidential election is at the center of Rebell’s push for a renewed focus and emphasis on civics education. The repercussions of the election also preface his book published last year, Flunking Democracy: Schools, Courts, and Civic Participation, in which he situates the root of our current polarized society in the decline of what was once a robust era of civic engagement. He starts by recalling the civic ethos of the Founding Fathers: “teach good political judgment, allow learning from prior generations’ mistakes and successes, and inculcate honesty, integrity, and compassion.” He then traces the decline of this ethos to the second half of the 20th century, arguing that civics curricula failed to address the new values, rights, and technology of changing times. In an age of deceptive news coverage, he believes students are required to have not only basic civics literacy but a critical understanding of media.<br><br>
            Both Robinson and Wood were quick to stress the overwhelming public support for an approach focusing on civics education. “This case causes and commands public conversation about the core purpose of public education,” said Wood. “Why do we even do this thing? We educate the public so they can participate in democracy in a knowing and informed way.” By aiming for a constitutional declaration instead of specific funding or curriculum reform, A.C. v. Raimondo doesn’t necessarily address the root causes of Rhode Island’s failing education systems such as shrinking property tax bases or structural racism in public schools. Yet these concerns are not necessarily ignored by the lawyers pushing a case in many ways intended to spark a conversation and establish a basis from which to argue subsequent legislation. “I think this will ultimately end up in the US Supreme Court,” said Robinson. “I just hope I live long enough to see it.”<br><br>

            Yesterday, my friend sat me down, told me that her friend had attempted suicide this past summer. 
            <br><br>
            “Why are we allowed to be happy but made to be so fearful of sadness?” she asked. 
            <br><br>
            “Actually, that is exactly why I am sad, because I feel as if I’m not allowed to be.” 
            <br><br>
            I felt indifferent about the event—the suicide and the retelling. But, as if preprogrammed, she bombs the conversation into the dark, abysmal land of confronting one’s demons: therapy, mental asylums, ugly truths (or convincing lies). In fact, the night had already teetered off balance early on, when I ordered fries and she ordered tea, and then I ordered tea and she ordered meatballs. There we were: eating fries, slicing up meatballs, rinsing oil with tea, wondering about life and what happens if we don’t live it. One large, overly seasoned mess. 
            <br><br>
            “I went to visit her a week after the incident,” 
            <br><br>
            “I had to push through two heavy doors, then round a sharp corner to finally arrive at this big, empty room.”

            “All the patients wore large blue shirts and thick yellow socks, like ducklings.”
            <br><br>
            “Oh, and before all that I had to sign my name, my reason for visiting, my relationship to the patient, all of that onto this piece of paper. Boyfriends, brothers, mothers, mothers, mothers, friends—the papers of signatories were thick.”
            <br><br>

         <a class="blurb">I reported on the recent USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) in light of the “exemplary immigrant” narrative pushed onto various Asian-American contenders during the 2018 Olympics.</a>
          <div class="article">
          <a class="link" href="https://www.theindy.org/1351">Head to Toe in All American: USCIS, the Olympics, and the paradigm of the exemplary immigrant</a><br><br>
          <img class="image" src="assets/im_1.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='assets/default.jpg'"><br><br>
          <a>A clear voice amid the static: “I will be rewarded. I worked my hardest and I will be rewarded.” The pronouncement of Mirai Nagasu echoes on, as it is relayed to viewers station after station, commentator after commentator—ESPN, CNN, NBC, Fred Roggin, Jon Champion, Liam McHugh. The Olympics is a stage where a nationalist posture is adopted with little reservation and this posture is then supported by both those competing and those enjoying. It has become one of the many symbols that signifies a healthy and inclusive country a—symbol which is amplified by the media as it turns statements like Nagasu’s into soundbites. As reporters were quick to note, Nagasu’s story readily resonated with the chorus of the American dream. This immigrant story, characterized by a strict work ethic and fervent determination, always proves to culminate in rewards; but seemingly, only when following an obedient, law-abiding narrative. This backhand dream is plastered everywhere—yet another projection of an explicitly white America that always fails to materialize. Yet myths, like any sort of national symbolism, are nevertheless productive, sustaining mass events like the Olympics.<br><br>
          The “exemplary immigrant,” the humble, rule-following immigrant who casts off their prior national identity and quickly assimilates, upholds these emblems of the American dream. These paradigmatic expectations have come to fruition in the form of various icons, symbols, and signifiers. The idea that immigrants must be superhuman to become American reinforces unrealistic narratives, such as the model minority myth, which the media perpetually underscored and reinforced in their accounts of non-white American Olympians. Lately, however, this mythology seems to have abandoned the identity of the immigrant entirely, now calling for an immediate assimilation into a corporate American culture.<br><br>
          This cultural erasure was most recently concretized in the US Citizenship and Immigration Services’ (USCIS) latest mission statement. The USCIS no longer sees America as “a nation of immigrants.” Rather, the phrase has been replaced with a call for “administering the nation’s lawful immigration system,” stating its main goal is not to “promote an awareness and understanding of citizenship” but rather to “efficiently and fairly adjudicate requests for immigration benefits.” A similar shift can be found throughout the coverage of America’s new Olympic team. Though dripping with the immigrant fantasy, the song was never written for immigrants; what rang in the ears of all watching Nagasu and Kim and the 18 other predominantly East-Asian Americans of this country’s team was the chorus that America had attributed to its immigrants, a rhythm written to be followed. What exactly did the prefix of “American” mean to these athletes?<br><br> 
          </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

          <a>          Nagasu’s record-breaking triple-axle and Chloe Kim’s golden half-pipe win were quickly cemented within the American Olympic canon—their faces were everywhere, but what they represented was much more than a win for their team, it was a win for the American team. The reporters didn’t hold back from reminding us of that distinction. Frills aside, the attention put on both Nagasu and Kim presents an age-old issue regarding the model minority myth—a skewed theory that justifies the relative success of certain minority groups over others. Nagasu and Kim, both emblematic of a privileged, East-Asian background, are the poster children for such a myth—one which asks those immigrating into this country to be eternally bound to a stage, to perpetually prove one’s worth and one’s abidance by American ideals. News outlets, reporting on Kim’s success, valorized her father. He made sacrifices like driving her long distances to practice, giving up a job to ensure Kim’s continued interest in snowboarding—things not unspecific to immigrant experiences. He has shown his will to fight through hardships and thus, as an NBC reporter applauded shortly after her win, “put an exclamation point on her family’s quintessential immigrant story.” In that same article, “Meet the American Snowboarder Who Won Gold,” Kim was not allowed to keep the title of ‘American’ for long, with the essay concluding on Kim’s roots: “Chloe is partial to calling herself ‘the California girl,’ but she went into her victorious day with Korean folklore at the front of her mind.”<br><br>
          Focusing on an athlete’s journey is not uncommon; focusing on the achievements of immigrants while simultaneously limiting their access to the country’s opportunities is not uncommon either. In fact, as of February 22 of this year, these attitudes live permanently in the mission statement of the agency held as the symbol for how America perceives immigrants. As the release of Olympic success stories was coming to a calm, USCIS surfaced with a big blow. These changes, spearheaded by newly appointed USCIS director Frank Cissna, subtly reflected deep-seated ideologies set forth by constructs like the model minority myth. What Cissna and the new statement were adamant in revealing is that these beliefs live far beyond the confines of the model minority myth.<br><br>
          AMOR, a Providence-based emergency response network of community organizations, has dealt with this fluctuating and increasingly hostile anti-immigrant sentiment since the launch of its 24-hour hotline on February 14. In an interview with the Independent last week, an anonymous AMOR community member discussed a recent Atlantic article, in which Trump’s ban on Dreamers was portrayed as more concerned about the “national origin and race of immigrants than the methods they used to enter the US.” They noticed a shift from the nation’s previous interest in ‘legal versus illegal’ immigration to a racist framework aimed at maintaining a majority white population in the US. Saddened by these particularly violent changes to the mission statement, they admitted that, nonetheless, they were not surprised. This is simply, to quote the AMOR member, “the latest incarnation of US imperialism and white nationalism, furthering an ‘us’ vs. ‘them’ narrative that serves to only recognize an immigrant’s utility, rather than their humanity.”<br><br>
          <img class="image" src="assets/olympics.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='assets/default.jpg'"><br>
          </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

          <a>          The conversation surrounding this recent change has cast a light on Cissna, who has managed to stay mostly behind the scenes in his work within immigration issues—the bulk of which was highly praised by the Trump administration. Prior to assuming his position as director of the USCIS, Cissna assisted Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley on Homeland Security, where, under Grassley’s name, he helped intensify department oversight on immigration. Among the letters drafted by Cissna were ones criticizing the March 2016 initiative that would give “Dreamers” the chance to obtain travel documents and work permits. Cissna, an immigrant himself, is fighting for approval not among fellow immigrants, but by those granting immigrants certain privileges. Cissna is not shy about his background, oftentimes citing it as the motivation for his decisions. In a statement to the Washington Post, he dwelled on his experience as an immigrant, stating that “[my] family is literally a product of our nation’s legal immigration system” and goes on to hallmark his success with what this nation has afforded him.<br><br>
          As the coverage surrounding Chloe Kim’s gold medal has worked to co-opt her success as nothing more than an immigrant triumph story, the same is being done onto Cissna by himself. For immigrants like Cissna, “success” means his inclusion in the “our” at the end of his recent mission statement, “securing the homeland, honoring our values.” Cissna’s strict abidance to white America’s judicial system mirrors the lens through which the success of immigrant athletes has been judged. By working to champion an idea of the model citizen, an exemplary immigrant, Cissna turns a blind eye to the fact that the USCIS statement glaringly accepts immigrants as perpetual “others.” Cissna states that “all applicants and petitioners should, of course, always be treated with the greatest respect and courtesy, but we can’t forget that we serve the American people,” a group which would not have included Cissna's own family, which petitioned for citizenship.<br><br>
          The role that Cissna has performed thus far is a convincing one, one that has surely earned him a spot as the ‘model immigrant,’ but one that upholds a certainty that the worth of all immigrants can only be measured by their ability to provide for Americans. Chloe Kim has cemented a spot in this ideal as well, but Shaun White, a snowboarder who equally amazed the world in his 2008 gold medal-run, didn’t start with nearly the level of expectations that Kim did. White, in an interview, mentioned Mountain Dew and donuts, and alluded to the medal as a great substitute for the usual parking pass one would have in their car. To this day, not much more is asked from White; 18 medals later, much of us have no clue about White’s family life and upbringing. Kim, however, remains forever attached to her roots. White America has been quick and desperate to position Kim as the ideal immigrant, stationing her alongside someone like Cissna, as another pawn in upholding American meritocracy. A similar fate was dealt to Nagasu in her failure to make the 2014 Olympic team, even though she had checked off all the requirements of a traditional Olympic athlete. The same team that now lauds Nagasu’s achievements chose Ashley Wagner, a white woman, to compete instead, forcing her to further prove herself as a valuable asset to the team. As an AMOR spokesperson pointed to, “this conversation is a way in which immigrant solidarity is disrupted by narratives of ‘good’ vs. ‘bad’ immigrants. It is essential that we recognize that all people deserve dignity, respect, and a home. All too often, government actions, such as this USCIS statement, seek to separate the immigrant community and further disenfranchise immigrants who do not fit a certain narrative of deservingness. All immigrants are deserving.”<br><br>  
          </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

          <a>
          The USCIS’s portrayal of America as “a nation of immigrants” is probably as credible a symbol as the nationalist promises of the Olympics—ultimately these hollow vessels are used to bolster a faulty and fragile American reputation. For immigrants, it is evident that espousing a model minority construct proves a pyrrhic victory, as the ultimate cost of their assimilation outweighs any possible benefits. High-achieving minorities, in this sense, do not escape their essentially foreign identities; rather, their accomplishments cement their place as exceptional, but no less excluded ‘players.’ Their hard work is mechanized as fodder for illuminating the American dream and further alienates all those that this nation posits as somehow inferior. Americans uphold their arguments for this dream, oblivious to its mythical nature, remaining uncritical of the discriminatory narrative. 
          The new Trump-era logic hopes to instill in immigrant groups across this nation that those seeking citizenship can have a role on America’s stage as long as they commit to being perpetually subordinate. The solution to this subordination is not to stop acknowledging immigrants for their achievements and the ethos of their cogent work ethic, but rather to stop attributing these feats exclusively to the exceptionalism of American nationhood.<br><br>

         <a class="blurb">I wrote about the weather, my visit to Vatnasfn (Library of Water), Roni Horn's installation in Styykisholmur, Iceland and her book Weather Reports You.</a>
          <div class="article">
          <a class="link" href="https://www.theindy.org/1497">“Some Notes on Weather, Potentialities, and Limitations: Roni Horn and the Icelandic abyss”</a><br><br>
          <img class="image" src="assets/rh_2.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='assets/default.jpg'"><br>
          <a><b>Preface</b><br><br>
            I recently acquired my first raincoat. It happened at the foot of the Vatnajökull glacier in Southeastern Iceland. “If you think you hate the weather in Iceland, wait five minutes and you’ll hate it more,” my glacier-hiking-arctic-adventures-guide teased, looking on at the soggy, ill-prepared herd of humans that had collected in front of him, each dense with water, fear, and whatever other feeling a 2,000-meter glacier should cast upon someone. Unlike the wool-dressed Icelandic sheep, humans aren’t fond of pack mentality—for the miles before this rain, we traveled always at a safe distance from each other. Nor are we fond of unexpected showers in 10-minute intervals. It was clear, my hair now sickeningly wet, that I was to be a sore match for the forces on this island. Erik offered me an extra raincoat. I thanked him, but by then the rain had subsided.<br><br>
            <em>In five minutes, I’d hate it more.</em><br><br>
            </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

            <a>            No one comes to Iceland to think less about the weather. And it’s not an easy thing to overlook. Its presence is made all the more palpable due to the absence of high-rises or rows of developments—just endless amounts of open air, lush fields. You either come prepared to be shot down by the blazing sun, scathing rain, burning geyser mist, freezing glacial water, or you stand there waiting to be molded by a mixture of these forces.<br><br>
            </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

            <a>            Aside from the weather, all I know about Iceland is an amalgam of facts skimmed from various postings on the walls of hotels and guesthouses: beer wasn’t legalized until 1989; three trees next to each other is deemed a forest; Iceland was the last place to be settled by humans. There is an air of placidity, miles of land free of barriers. Everyone who visits feels as if they’ve discovered something secret, or have woken up a resting giant. And all are eager to share.<br><br>
            This fascination has influenced a large number of artists, both Icelandic and many foreign, all turning to Iceland as a place for inspiration and clarification. Icelandic-Danish artist Olafur Eliasson has long exalted Iceland as a place largely similar to that of a studio itself: “Actually, a lot of public spaces seem to suggest that you can use the space to—I wouldn't say ‘reinvent’ yourself, but at least ‘reconsider’ yourself.” The light, landscape, and weather above all, are unmistakable in Eliasson’s work. In May of 2017, he opened Studio Olafur Eliasson in downtown Reykjavik, which is now open to the public. His most celebrated piece, known as “the weather project” employed humidifiers and hundreds of monochromatic lamps; disseminated mist and a radiating yellow light flooded the Turbine Hall at the Tate Modern in London. Art critic Brian O’Doherty, in a description of the installation to Frieze magazine, illustrates the space as: “enormously dismal—like a coffin for a giant— but was socialized in an effective way.”<br><br>
            The climate Eliasson installed transformed what once was a large empty space, where people moved past each other unknowingly, into a space where all collectively gathered under the sun. The severity of it and the proximity that people in Iceland have to weather has shifted the way Eliasson experiences weather conditions in London or other metropolitan areas. He brings these unvarnished episodes of weather into the steel-framed Turbine Hall, with its old construction crane still hanging above, and visitors instantly feel the weight of gravity. The only reasonable next step being sitting down, breathing in the mist, and letting themselves be smothered by the light. For Eliasson, he believes it is, “one of the few fundamental encounters with nature that can still be experienced in the city.” He goes on to explain that, “As inhabitants, we have grown accustomed to the weather as mediated by the city. This takes place in numerous ways, on various collective levels ranging from hyper‑mediated (or representational) experiences, such as the television weather forecast, to more direct and tangible experiences, like simply getting wet while walking down the street on a rainy day. A level between the two extremes would be sitting inside, looking out of a window onto a sunny or rainy street.”<br><br>
            I think about my hiking herd and how weather made friends of us; we walked the miles before the downpour in silence, and the miles after laughing and damning the rain.<br><br>
            </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

            <a>            During an Icelandic winter, the sun shines for four hours a day. In summer, it doesn’t set until 10 at night. Between all of this, the wind and rain sustain. For Icelanders, having to deal with a riotous sky or a turbulent ocean is never a bitter pill. Visitors for 10 days, 100, a year, may never navigate Iceland in the same way. For starters, the Icelandic language has developed around 56 words for wind alone, some meaning close to storm and some alluding to a calmer state. But what keeps visitors coming back is the hope that they might begin to learn the how’s and what’s. Many of the artists (even native-born Icelanders) who find spaces to work in Iceland only end up doing so temporarily. But all continue to dwell on their experiences and talk candidly about the impact. The question is not why they care so much about the landscape, the culture, and the weather; it is a question of how a place reminds them that they do.  
            Perhaps no visitor has attempted to answer this question as committedly as artist and writer Roni Horn. A native of New York, Horn initially visited Iceland out of college and has returned constantly since the mid-70s. Her oeuvre, in photography, writing, installation, and various other mediums is much like the Icelandic weather she is fervently in awe of: difficult, and oftentimes impossible to grasp. Only for viewers and readers to marvel at and be made curious by—as if it were another climate or a combination of many. Intimately communal yet vastly solitary, Iceland and Horn have depended on each other for company. And Icelanders have welcomed Horn as they do most visitors, enthusiasts, and wanderers to their island. Over 100 local residents have collaborated with Horn in her studies with the weather, offering their personal experiences and sharing what continually draws them home. Horn, along with Oddný Eir Ævarsdóttir, an Icelandic writer, pursued various residents of the towns of Stykkisholmur and Helgafellssveit. The 197-page book titled Weather Reports You is told through the experiences of police officers, sailors, farmers, and preschool teachers. All seem to harbor a quiet understanding that those who visit have all come to quench some desire. A desire to feel one might be an infinite stranger, or that their proximity with everything else is unbounded. And being on this island makes those desires a fact, that we still have many conversations to make with nature. And being exposed to its daily forces fuels Horn’s fascination and frustration. Both with how little we know and how much we never will, about the water we drink or the rain. “During the many months of making these interviews, I learned something important about Iceland…” Ævarsdóttir reflects, “I can’t say exactly what it is...but it’s connected with people’s different ways of reading their environment and the people around them, living in the whirlwinds of memories and forgetfulness.”<br><br>
            “My weather began back in grade school. In class, the teacher announced a hurricane was on its way. With that, she dismissed us and emphatically instructed: ‘Run home!’ Scared at first, exhilarated afterward, I ran all the way,” begins Horn in the introduction of Weather Reports You. This book and the recordings have proven, most importantly, the length that Horn has gone to bridge herself with the surrounding communities, and the importance of this gesture. Aside from the introduction, in all 197 pages, her name is almost absent. And aside from the brief introduction,  she allows only those who have tampered with this climate their entire lives to speak on it. They do so proudly, many having not thought much about this everyday occurrence. Some speak about the perils of boating, or simply being outside. And some just hate when the weather prevents them from simply playing basketball. Horn’s desire has always been not to recreate but to pass on, in whatever language best suited, the feeling that the island has instilled in her. Echoing the sentiments of Eliasson, Horn has long used Iceland as her makeshift studio and in her most ambitious project to date, all of Horn’s abiding interests are displayed subtly but clearly.<br><br>

            The Library of Water, or Vatnasfn, is a building which rests quietly on a promontory, overlooking the town of Styykishölmur. The library houses an installation of 24 glass columns. The language of these pillars is much like that of her sculptures: each pillar contains water collected from some of the most famous glaciers in Iceland. Cast in solid glass and standing floor to ceiling, the properties of the water reflect and refract the town, its buildings, and the people who visit the library. At some angles, we see ourselves as one with the red lighthouse that faces the window. In others, we’ve melted in with the reflection of neighboring columns; the surfaces of these are constantly in flux, much like the reflection of oneself in water. The pillars are clustered at the entrance of the library and in front of the walkway to the seating area. We make ourselves fit, swerving and spreading ourselves across the space created. Much like rain, in some areas, we cannot move without dodging a pillar and in all areas, the reflections of the 24 pillars constantly change the visuals we are experiencing.<br><br>
            The choice of Styykishölmur, a town on the western coast of Iceland, as home to this artistic venture is intentional. It is the home of many of the interviewees in Weather Reports You and Vatnasfn houses the tapes of these recordings; in 1845, it also coincidentally began recording the first regular measurement of weather. Upon finding this building, which was used only to house books in transit to other places, Horn negotiated with the town mayor on a renewal of the building, proposing for it to be a public space. Above all, Horn hoped it would be a place that reflected the history and culture of the island. Upon being granted permission, Horn placed down sheets of rubber flooring and set off to collect what would become the library’s 24 columns. Now in its 11th year, the library is used as a community space and visitors are invited to attend events, sometimes with shows by performers like Ragnar Kjartansson and Laurie Anderson. During its less busy seasons, Vatnasfn is accessible by a code, which you can retrieve by visiting the Volcano Museum down the hill. Some leave books, notes, and writing. Others come to browse the catalogs and listen to the recordings. A management staff comes to check up on the space from time to time, but in general, it is left as is. All that is asked of visitors is to remove their shoes. The general preservation of this place comes not from strict policing, but an understanding that there is something sacred preserved here—be it experience, emotion, or bits of Iceland’s landscape—and it is up to all who come upon it to respect and nurture it.<br><br>  
            For many, it is rare to be able to see the landscape so clearly, unfettered by much else. And when the rain hits harder, one becomes more alert. Both of how humans are affected by our surroundings and our obvious shortcomings in understanding and dealing with nature. Though Horn tends to be somehow both subtle and conspicuous about her intentions, it is easy to feel that her work with Vatnasfn comes from a level of urgency. Parts of the casted water comes from the Vatnajokull Glacier, also known as “Fat Yogurt” for those less privy to the Icelandic tongue. It is a glacier superstar, one of the largest of its kind (by volume) in Europe and covers more than nine percent of the island alone. Even in its grandiosity, a glaciologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office has reported that more than ten percent of the glacier has melted since 1890 and the land around has risen by approximately 25 millimeters just within this past year. All of Iceland's glaciers are melting; the weather has become, more so now than ever, ominously unpredictable across the world. These pillars stand as testaments to loss, but even more as icons of hope. When faced, on a human scale, with a force normally too large to comprehend, we’re reminded of the beauty in Iceland’s glaciers.  Horn forces our movements to literally blend with these pillars, and we feel how interconnected we are to their livelihood.<br><br>
            Past the bevy of glass columns is the back room, where one may sit, listen, and as Horn hoped, find commonality under the weather—see it both in its true scale and on an individual scale. “I imagine the weather reports of Laramie, Palermo, Hudson Bay, Gorky, Lake Baikal, Timbuktu and so on. Iceland is only a starting point. But Iceland more than most places is a country that has forcibly been made to experience the weather as the dominant, essentially unpredictable presence that influences the outcome of all things on the island.”<br><br>

            <b>Preface</b><br><br>
            Today I am stopping by the town of Höfn, the largest town in Southern Iceland. Still, there is only one convenience store in the center. It sells few imported products, lots of dairy. Although the car I have is a hefty 4x4, it’s heavily misaligned from bouts of rough rental usage. Rough not from off-roading or poor behind-the-wheel habits but weathered by a terrain that was never meant for cars. Höfn boasts the island’s best seafood, even lobster dipped in chocolate. If you’re lucky, soup always waits at the end of a treacherous journey.<br><br>
            On the off chance I look out the window, I see a red chair set atop a rock. Someone has left it there I assume (for viewing pleasures? forgotten?) and it stands as if it’d been drilled into the gravel, unfettered by the wind. How well we weather a storm depends on many things: stamina, courage, familiarity, intent. In this case, I was ruefully beat out by painted plywood. I was tempted to take a break, take a seat on this chair, see if I could learn anything.
            Nearing Höfn, I passed my third waterfall; across it landed flocks of swans, puffins, and around it clusters of horses and sheep grazed. Across it, another rainbow. Due to the rain, I’ve seen six and a half rainbows in 10 days.<br><br>
            It’s nearing 10 pm and the last of the sunset has left the sky; it’s raining again outside. A dull knocking rain. PLONK, PLONK, PLONK. I’m hesitant to draw the blinds, as it has proved to be quite the event for me here, always taking upwards of 15 to 20 minutes. Each time I find myself paralyzed and stupefied, staring at the vast abysmal land, not lit by a single streetlamp. An uncanny mix of awe, shock, longing, and terror.<br><br><br>

            <b>Excerpts from Weather Reports You:</b><br><br>
            <em>When I was a little girl, I lived in a very good place as far as the weather was concerned. In bad weather, it was horrible. Everything shook and rattled and you lay awake at night wondering what would happen if the house was blown out to sea. Oh yes, I just made a ship of it, if it blows away it’s bound to turn upside down and sail on its roof and then I’m safe inside the house. I lived with that until I was almost ten.<br><br>
            When I was twelve, I lost my uncle at sea, so I’m not really terribly fond of storms and the sea. The weather is always connected with the sea in my mind. That’s what puts the fear into me the most, the sea. If the sea starts moving, I know what to expect.

            <em>I never see the sun without starting to tingle and I’m outside at once. I was at sea for nine years. Once when I was on board the trawler Skúli Magnússon (I think it was the Skúli Magnússon, rather than the Jón Þorláksson) I was out on the Halinn grounds and we ran into strong, nasty weather, hauled in the trawl and headed for land. But it was snowing, there was a raging storm and heavy frost, and that was when I felt in most danger at sea. I was so tired of smashing the ice off all the ropes and as soon as I turned around everything was covered again. Sometimes when a sheep went missing and you saw a snowdrift somewhere, well into the spring, if there was a little grass sprouting alongside the snowdrift, you could always be sure the sheep was there. The sheep never left those gullies the whole winter and it was warm. I remember that because I was a kid on the farm and I was like the family dog, they sent me out to fetch the sheep from the snowdrifts.

            <em>Several years ago, I was very depressive, I often used to think then that you don’t know which came first, the chicken or the egg, if and how the weather affected my depression, for better or for worse. And I remember at that time I was shut in here by myself a lot, I shut myself away and there was an incredible amount of salty northerly storms. No snow on the streets but brine and seawater spraying everything so all the windows turn grey and the asphalt jet black although it is just dry. If you pull yourself together and go outdoors to scrape the salt off it gets a little brighter, you feel a little brighter. There’s also the question if I felt the weather [was] was worse because I was unbalanced.

            <em>I had to go up onto the mountain every single day, whatever the weather. So I ought to have some definition of the changeability of the weather. But I’m such a blockhead. It’s a fact that even if you do something daily that has an effect on you, it’s as if it never sticks in your mind as a special phenomenon. Unless you’re hit over the head!

         <a class="blurb">I speak with essayist, editor, and translator Eliot Weinberger on his new translation of Chinese author Bei Dao’s writing, and A Restless Melancholy, an event honoring the work of Weinberger’s friend, poet Forrest Gander. We talk about hesitation, the essay as form, and the internet. </a>
          <div class="article">

          <img class="image" src="assets/bd_el.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='assets/default.jpg'"><br>
          <a class="link" href="https://www.theindy.org/1571">“Brief Elemental Things: A conversation with essayist, editor, and translator Eliot Weinberger”</a><br><br>
          
          <a>
              Robert Atwan likened the essay form to a solitary, restless individual; Montaigne believed essays could only be written in paces; Hilton Als considered the essay as concentrated life. Defining the essay has proved a more elusive task than the essay itself. And few have stretched its limits as wide as Eliot Weinberger. He has often attributed his preference for essays, for fact over fiction, to his lack of imagination. But Weinberger, knowingly or not, has pushed the essay genre to unimagined ends.<br><br>
              His stories cover nearly every corner of the world, and render even familiar places surreal, as if we’re hearing them described for the first time. In Weinberger’s 2016 essay collection, The Ghost of Birds, the first story begins quite literally with creation, titled “The Story of Adam and Eve.” By the middle few essays, we’re asked to consider George Bush Jr. as a “postmodernist” as Weinberger feeds readers details as granular as the “hot coat hanger” he used to “brand the buttocks of pledges to the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.” We end the collection of essays somewhere in Albania, walking the Great Wall with presidents past.<br><br>
              Weinberger’s approach to translation is equally as brazen and sweeping: “One can translate Moby-Dick even if one has never hunted whales,” he asserts. Shortly after finding a book of poems by Octavio Paz in his high school library, Weinberger started translating from the Spanish. By 19, he’d become friends with Paz and worked for years as a primary translator of his work. Along with his essays, he’s gone on to translate from Chinese, working closely with poet Bei Dao.
              “Weinberger tracks cycles of human violence and dreaming, like huge vortical whirlwinds,” writes poet Forrest Gander, “they stalk each other across the widening desert tracts of human history.” Weinberger, Bei Dao, New Directions—Gander and Weinberger’s publisher—gathered with others at Brown University last week as part of a two-day celebration of Forrest Gander, who retired from his post as Adele Kellenberg Seaver Professor of Literary Arts & Comparative Literature this Fall. In the weeks leading up to the event, the Independent spoke with Weinberger sporadically over email, discussing his voracious approach to the world.<br><br>
              </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

              <a>The College Hill Independent: Reading your stories has offered me, among other feelings: solace, humor, unease, hope, and I am looking forward to experiencing it all in person at your reading and through our exchange.<br><br>
              Eliot Weinberger: Well thank you—but they’re not really “my stories.” I sometimes have stories in my writing, but they’re other people’s stories, which I retell.<br><br>

              The Indy: Can you share your relationship with the poet and professor Forrest Gander and to his work? The title of the event, A Restless Melancholy—how does it resonate with you personally?<br><br>
              EW: I don’t feel particularly restless or melancholic. I can sit for many hours in a chair just happily and blankly staring. Forrest has been my friend forever. I read everything he publishes, and he’s one of the very few writers whose next book I’m eager to read. Among many other things, he is a master—in both the poetry and the fiction—of landscape and the invocation of place. I wish I knew how he does it.<br><br>

              The Indy: Every interviewer you’ve sat with has begun their introduction with hesitation—finding your work unclassifiable. There is a sense of responsibility in your work. Not for an audience nor reportage, but a desire to feel as if you’ve communicated a story across in as genuine a manner as possible. Have you thought about yourself as a messenger? Have you ever had any desire to classify your work?<br><br>
              EW: I’m certainly not a journalist, in that I rarely deal with the present and I do not go somewhere to report on what I have seen. Messengers convey someone else’s words, which they are supposed to do verbatim. In my writing, all the words, or almost all the words, are mine—what is not mine is the information. I don’t make anything up or blur the line between fiction and non-fiction. And I’m afraid I always associate messengers with angels: the Biblical word for angel in Hebrew (ma’lak) and Greek (angelos) means “messenger.” Needless to say, I don’t qualify.
              I consider myself an essayist, though some of my essays are more like stories and some are more like poems. I try to write them as one writes a poem: listening to the sounds and trying to present exact and concrete images. But their lack of imagination means that they are neither fiction nor poetry.<br><br>

              The Indy: You’ve often mentioned that you were first drawn to the essay because it’d been “collecting dust, untouched since 18th century English.”<br><br>
              EW: Yes, with a few exceptions, it still follows the 18th (or earlier) century format of the narrative of a first-person investigation. In English, at least, it largely hasn’t had the wild range of open possibilities that poetry and fiction have had for a hundred years. So it struck me as unexplored territory.<br><br>

              The Indy: Reading essays on the internet have become common practice. You were booed off stage at St. Mark’s Poetry Project for voicing your support for the internet and digitized text. Most recently, you’ve revealed that the internet has “kind of ruined [my] life.” How has the “essay” changed in the 21st century with the rise of the internet? You’ve talked often about what the internet makes possible in terms of access in the Third World. Has it rendered anything impossible?<br><br>
              EW: To clarify: very early on I thought the internet was the best thing to have happened to literature, in that interested readers far from urban centers—and particularly readers in the Third World, without decent libraries—would suddenly have access to so much of the world’s writing. In 1994, on a panel at St Mark’s on “poetry and revolution,” I was widely ridiculed for saying that the internet was about to be a powerful political force. (Amiri Baraka, for one, responded, “The revolution is not going to come from a bunch of yuppies with laptops.”) As Fidel Castro used to say, history has absolved me.
              My recent joke in an interview that the internet has ruined my life was referring to email, the information overload, and current life in Trump USA, where there are three or four unbelievable new developments daily. (Unlike, say, the Bush era, when the news was depressing, but was basically more of the same every day.) It’s become, as we all know, difficult to concentrate on anything else.
              The internet has, of course, changed nearly everything, but the consolation of literature is that it hasn’t changed fiction, poetry, or essays at all. They remain what they are—the only difference is that more people can find them.<br><br>

              </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

              <a>               
              The Indy: You are no stranger to the current political climate, having laid it out meticulously in “Ten Days in Trump’s America” for this past October’s London Review of Books. It seems that the ideas you’ve built your writing career on—reaching past American literature, immediate cultures, and imminent borders—are antithetical to the current US agenda.<br><br>
              EW: My writing always comes out of either curiosity or indignation. Curiosity for the literary essays, indignation for the political. The literary essays are almost entirely located in other cultures; the political essays—and there were many more during the Iraq War—are about the USA. The little bit I have done my whole life has been completely opposed and contrary to the current xenophobic and racist agenda of Trump and, more important, the entire Republican party.<br><br>
               
              </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

              <a>               
              The Indy: As an essayist, you always mention your desire for truth; I’d like to get your thoughts on something I read recently. American psychologist Jon Haidt, published an essay this past October where he positions Karl Marx against John Stuart Mill, one as the patron of “Social Justice,” another as “Truth” respectively. Can you speak about truth and its nuances, if you believe there are any?<br><br>
              EW: I can’t talk about universities, having never had any academic affiliations. Of course, I believe in absolute freedom of speech. Nevertheless, there is a difference between the freedom to say what you like and the institutional validation of what you say. Academic articles like Haidt’s imagine a Platonic dialogue between enlightened and reasonable conservatives and liberals, which is simply not the current reality. Steve Bannon is not John Stuart Mill. The so-called conservatives these days are not conservative at all, but mongers of hate, and you can hear their opinions easily enough on Fox News and on the internet. So no, I don’t believe in giving racists a platform (and a speaking fee!) at a university in the name of “open debate.”<br><br>

              The Indy: On the topic of academia, you haven’t always been on the periphery of institutions, hailing from rather prestigious academic settings, from The Putney School to your brief stint at Yale. And in some ways, poetry, the literary arts, have always felt antagonistic to the academic setting. How do you think poetry ought to be taught?<br><br>
              EW: I went to a wonderful progressive high school, Putney, on a farm in Vermont, and then barely made it through a year at Yale, which at the time was still a boys' school full of Brett Kavanaugh types. Having had no academic connections since, I naturally have a reactionary idea of what a university should be. I'm afraid I think that anyone who wants to be a writer should study anything—biology, anthropology, astronomy, history, religion—except "creative writing." It helps to know something. And I'm afraid I think that, in literature, students should study what they otherwise wouldn't read. That means no living writers. After all, there are thousands of years of literature to catch up on.<br><br>
               
              </a><p class="center-cross">+++<br><br></p>

              <a>
              The Indy: So many things are happening and at an egregious speed, how do you deal with overconsumption? What do you do to combat feeling overwhelmed?<br><br>
              EW: Happily. I travel quite a bit and when I travel I don’t read. I just look around.<br><br>

          <a>“One day, I’ll have to put it all alone at the beginning of the film. He told that if they don’t see happiness in the picture, at least they would see black.”<br>
          - Chris Marker, Sans Soleil<br><br>

          Minutes into Chris Marker’s 1982 film Sans Soleil (Sunless), we hear the narrator, Sandra Krasna, reciting someone else’s lines, with a message that carries three perspectives: the speakers, the addressee, and some unnamed audience. The picture that “he” was referring to was one of three Nordic children, crisp Icelandic air breezing through their thin blond hair, frolicking across an open grassland, their eye contact zoning in and out of focus with the viewer. This image is shown for not much longer than two or three seconds, with the rest of the section narrated against a black screen—the black that was promised to those who could find no happiness in the empty screen. The placeless, drawn-out narration simultaneously confuses the viewer and holds the viewer hostage before the screen, as if nothing might symbolize everything, or at least the possibility of imagining everything.<br><br> 

          The scenes come at us unceremoniously, sometimes pushing us towards ASMR bliss, other times towards bad posture and irritation. We find ourselves seated on a bus, looking out towards Japan, South America, and anywhere in between, being told stories that could have only occurred on the other side of the world.<br><br>

          Marker situates us within a certain frame of mind but refuses to fix a dominant interpretation, continually opening back up to a blank screen, a sense of sheer openness borne out of rupture and incongruity. If we didn’t find happiness in the three Nordic children or the Japanese masked dancers, at least we would see a blank screen, a site for projection. If we didn’t find happiness while looking at the flat grasslands of Iceland or gawking at lovers on a bench, at least we’d be met with an empty stage, a meaningless color where we might indulge ourselves in what we felt happy with or, at the very least, the absence of anything at all. This black screen, for the moments it appears, offers itself as a canvas on which viewers may take up the task of illustrating what they want to see, guided by the narration and visuals provided before and after these moments of black. Viewer A might draw a snail—one eye 3 inches lower than the other, skin all patchy­—a snail that made them happy. Viewer B might envision a puddle or a light shining through a window. Marker’s job here is to introduce a space of indeterminacy. Some of the most pronounced images we see early in the film—a still shot of a megaphone, followed by a pair of hands—imply a sense of both direction and purpose, as if one is being invited to some grand political project. A sort of call for utopia, or a radical new blankness that is nevertheless generative. The viewer situates their role against the backdrop and the images speak: “Follow me! Come, follow me…”<br><br>

          Stepping into Penelope Umbrico’s installation Suns from Sunsets on Flickr brings the viewer to a wall overcrowded with sunsets, though all are low-resolution mass-reproductions clumsily plastered to the gallery wall. What had once been a tastefully sparse gallery setting is now saturated, overflowing with cheap printouts, flailing at the edges. It’s as if Umbrico has answered Marker’s call to fill the blank space—the space once sunless—all too thoroughly. In place of a generative openness, we arrive at the generic, the cliche, the tired and exhausted. Too much sun; too much clarity. While Marker’s blank screen appears to us with no content, Umbrico’s wall of sunsets inundated us with too much. The reaction to both of these extremes is determined by how the viewer inserts themselves into the work, though neither Marker nor Umbrico offers specific guidance on how one must move through the film and the photographs. Initially, it is tempting to situate the explorations of Umbrico against those of Marker: Umbrico offers us a lot, in crystal clear depiction; Marker offers us everything, but with no clarity. In offering us a lot, Umbrico strips her photographs completely of individual nuance. Marker, though offering us plenty of space to personalize and to generate, suspends us within a singular collective event. There is a nearly 30-year generational gap between Marker, who worked in the 1970s, and Umbrico, who worked in the early 2000s. This makes us consider: have we exhausted that radical emptiness? Is any personal memory, any individual experience, an exclusive instant of history, impossible?<br><br>

          Marker subjects each viewer to a collective experience by presenting an unyielding idea of what his own memories constitute. We’re all held within a similar experience, and we cannot insert our own experiences into the void of the screen. However, in Umbrico’s work, there is an evident desire to add more. Umbrico refuses emptiness, filling up the wall corner to corner—and yet, each passing spectator feels the need to take their own photograph, thus adding to the digital commons that Umbrico initially drew from. There is a feeling that this number is not enough, as if this composite image of human happiness and a common natural phenomenon is never enough to make one realize the futility of any individualizing act. Even if you are alone, you can turn the camera on yourself. Even if the sunset you witnessed yesterday cannot be found on the wall, you have an opportunity tomorrow at 5:18 to capture the sunset again.<br>
          Both artists present a breakthrough in the politics of the collective. While the two artists have undeniably different visions—Marker presents the details of individual experience, and Umbrico shows us the impossibility of individuality—in both works, we begin and end on a blank slate, or with the sun. Our individual sketches melt into one another and we are back where we began, with the sunrise and the sunset beginning and concluding each day.</a><br><br>

          It would be negligent to speak on the works of both these artists without situating them within their respective political and situational timeframes. Marker was a part of the Left Bank Film group, a collection of filmmakers whose work focused more on people and their immediate political, social, physical environment. Realizing the broad and difficult task of recording and representing humanity, the group of filmmakers focused largely on themselves and their personal collections, and through this, they encouraged their viewers to undergo a similar process. The political and societal unrest present during this time led Marker and colleagues to uphold a sense of individuality, and use a singular voice to speak against the events happening around them.<br><br> 

          Umbrico’s work came at a time when the method of viewing media was changing at a drastic pace. The insurgence of media sharing sites like Flickr, Youtube, Instagram, and Twitter, would have been an unimaginable future for the artists of Marker’s time, as it allowed each individual to shine a light on their personal experience in a collective manner. Umbrico seems to be posing two questions: what do you know? And, what do I know? In Umbrico’s work, it is no longer a matter of giving and receiving between artist and viewer, but rather of a collective experience. This collective effort loses the singular within the universal and comes not to a solution, but to a process of solving. Drawing on visuals and emotions that we are all hyper-accustomed to and using a repetitive aesthetic experience, Umbrico flattens out the individual experience and situates it on the same plane as the collective experience. Through both of these works, ideas of kitsch, popularity, and stereotypes, might appear anew as not something from which we should shy away, but something we should accept. We stare up, together, at these numerous suns all setting collectively, and are showered by what we expect each day at 5:18pm—this light erases all I’s and You’s and collects only We’s.<br><br> 

          When we’re shown the image of “happiness” as the three Icelandic children, we are included in the present collective happiness, whether or not we connect to the image provided. When we pose before the backdrop of 541,795, or 2,303,057, or even 30,240,577 “Suns (from Sunsets) on Flickr,” we are included in a collective process of documenting ourselves and this event. How long have we been existing on this flattened landscape? Was it new with Marker? With Umbrico? Have we, since then, developed a stronger collective consciousness?
          Sans Soleil ends where it starts: with the sun setting, a sun-less scene, a volcano covering the view of an entire town, dark hugging all that exists within it. Walking away, we each hold our own vacuous image of the Icelandic children, of green pastures, and of a bright-lit sky.<br><br>
